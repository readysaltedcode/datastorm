# datastorm
A data driven ballet linking climate science and computer science theory. Using wearable technology with biometric sensors, Kinect, data visualisation and projection mapping.

The second ballet in the series titled "Art of Computer Science" we are looking at internet theory, data transission and weather data to create a beautiful ballet to visualise those abstract concepts and theories. This work is a continuing collaboration between readysaltedcode CIC, industry experts and Battle Abbey School Students.
